This repo requires tensorlfow 1.15.0 and cuda 7.0
This repo is a fork from cleaverhans. I have modified Two files. The first is the mnst_tutorial_jsma.py, navigating from the NJSMA 
direcgtory. The file is in the cleaverhans_tutorials. This is the file you will run. Lines 38-45 set parameters like sample size, random 
seed, and use trained network or train new network.Lines 212 to 302 are detecting the number of nieghboring pixels in each image. 
Lines 325 to 370 are where the program prints the results to the screen.

The second file I modified was the saliency_map_method.py. From the NJSMA directory this file is located at cleverhans/attacks/saliency_map_method.py
This file contains the JSMA algorithm implementation. Line 241 is the orignal algorithm, line 242 is the modified algorithm.
